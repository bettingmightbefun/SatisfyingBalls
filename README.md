# New Project Starter

This repository has been cleared out and is ready for a fresh project setup. Feel free to initialize your preferred tooling, add dependencies, and start building from a clean slate.

## Getting Started

1. Decide on your stack (frontend, backend, tooling, etc.).
2. Initialize any package managers or build systems you need.
3. Create your source directories and begin implementing your application.

Happy building!
